This project is my bot for the ants aichallenge (https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/), run in 2011. Its long gone, but I found out just lately (2016), so I use the game to work my brain and learn about AI. I use the bots of other people posted in the forums as opponents and my goal is to beat the winner.

This bot is in C++ and project files are from Visual Studio 2012
